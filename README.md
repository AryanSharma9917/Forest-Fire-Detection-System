# Forest-Fire-Detection-System
This project is an attempt to use detect the forest fire using **IoT Sensors** and confirm it using **Deep Learning Algorithms** like CNN, VGG16, VGG19.

## Sensors Used
  - Arduino (NodeMCU32): NodeMCU is a low-cost open source IoT platform. It initially included firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which was based on the ESP-12 module. Later, support for the ESP32 32-bit MCU was added.

  - Infrared Sensor: An infrared sensor (IR sensor) is a radiation-sensitive optoelectronic component with a spectral sensitivity in the infrared wavelength range 780 nm … 50 µm.

  - Bulb: Lights on and off.

  - Air Quality Sensor (MQ-135): The gas sensor module consists of a steel exoskeleton under which a sensing element is housed. This sensing element is subjected to    current through connecting leads. This current is known as heating current through it, the gases coming close to the sensing element get ionized and are absorbed by the sensing element.

  - Buzzer: The flexible ferromagnetic disk is attracted to the coil when the magnetic field is activated, then returns to rest when the magnetic field is off. By oscillating the signal through the coil, the buzzer produces a fluctuating magnetic field, which vibrates the disk. This movement makes the buzzer sound.

  - Temperature & Humidity Sensor: Humidity sensors work by detecting changes that alter electrical currents or temperature in the air. There are three basic types of humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive and thermal. All three types will monitor minute changes in the atmosphere in order to calculate the humidity in the air.
